# Consulting and Facilitation
## Using story-sharing and embodied exercises to create communities of creative risk-takers

### My theatre background and research into the formation and representation of communities give me a unique perspective on diversity, equity, and inclusion work. In my consulting and facilitation, I start with "character exploraiton": a _deep assessment_ of where individuals and organizations are initially in terms of their levels of understanding and comfort around issues related to identity, power, and privilege. I then follow up with _community building_ (games and exercises), _skills building_ (foundational concepts and language), and _action-oriented creative risk-taking_ (roleplay and co-coreation of strategies and practices).

## CORE TENANTS
* *Failure is a part of the process; if you're not failing, you're not going deep enough*
* *Community building is as important as skill building*
* *All stakeholders need to be (or become) invested in the process for transformational change to occur*
* *It takes more than a day; while goal-oriented metrics are important, this work is an ongoing process*
* *Opportunities to practice need to be build into the process*
* *All discussions and interventions must eventually move beyond the interpersonal to include analysis and recognition of systemic inequities and injustice*

### A note about my practice as a White, DEI facilitator:
#### For the majority of my facilitation work, I collaborate with other experts with diverse identities and experiences from my own. I believe in the importance of diverse facilitation teams because *representation matters* and folks will receive information differently based on their identities and those of the facilitators. I also understand the limitations of my experiences as a White Woman in understanding how oppression operates on us at the macro and micro levels. 
#### As recognition of the additional labor required of my collaborators of color and historic and systemic wage and power gaps, I commit 20% of my pay back to them. On the occasions that I facilitate a DEI workshop solo, I commit to donating 20% of my pay to organizations who are focused on reparations and rectifying systemic economic and social inequity.

## Testimonials:

##### *When seeking a practitioner to hire for our department's initiatives around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Anti-Racism it was important to find someone who understood the field but also valued approaching this work as a starting point rather than a 'one-and-done' workshop. we received that and more from Liz Foster-Shaner. Her approach to this work combines compassion, deep questioning
