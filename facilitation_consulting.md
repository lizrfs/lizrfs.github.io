# Consulting and Facilitation
#### Using story-sharing and embodied exercises to create communities of creative risk-takers

##### A note about my practice as a White, DEI facilitator:
###### For the majority of my facilitation work, I collaborate with other experts with diverse identities and experiences from my own. I believe in the importance of diverse facilitation teams because *representation matters* and folks will receive information differently based on their identities and those of the facilitators. I also understand the limitations of my experiences as a White Woman in understanding how oppression operates on us at the macro and micro levels. 
###### As recognition of the additional labor required of my collaborators of color and historic and systemic wage and power gaps, I commit 20% of my pay back to them. On the occasions that I facilitate a DEI workshop solo, I commit to donating 20% of my pay to organizations who are focused on reparations and rectifying systemic economic and social inequity.
