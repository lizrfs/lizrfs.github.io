# About me

###  I am a White, cis-gendered woman, mother, educator, artist, and activist, originally from Jenner, CA and currently finding my place, purpose, and community in Pittsburgh, PA. In Pittsburgh, I am collaborating with others to develop creative social justice programs that focus on community-building, risk-taking, and an analysis of systemic inequity. I have a PhD in Theatre Research from University of Wisconsin-Madison and a BA in Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies and Political Science from University of California, Berkeley. My doctoral research, praxis, and teaching focused on theatre for cultural and social awareness and the development and representation of community both on and off the stage. I carry that analysis of community into my work with individuals and organizations. 

### Currently, with funding from Heinz Endowments, the Three Rivers Community Foundation, and Remake Learning, I am co-developing workshops and projects that examine and reimagine our roles and opportunities for change as active citizens of our local communities and places of practice. 

### As a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion consultant with Inclusant and DLJ Associates, I have facilitated workshops and trainings for the Racial Justice Summit, Pittsburgh Inclusive Innovation Week, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, Carlow University, Carnegie Mellon University, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania, among others.
